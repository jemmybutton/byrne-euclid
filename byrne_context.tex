\startintro[title={Introduction}]

\regularLettrine{T}{he} \kerncharacters[0.005]{arts and sciences have become so extensive, that to facilitate their acquirement is of as much importance as to extend their boundaries. Illustration, if it does not shorten the time of study, will at least make it more agreeable. This Work has a greater aim than mere illustration; we do not introduce colors for the purpose of entertainment, or to amuse \emph{by certain combinations of tint and form}, % don't know where this is from 
but to assist the mind in its researches after truth, to increase the facilities of introduction, and to diffuse permanent knowledge. If we wanted authorities to prove the importance and usefulness of geometry, we might quote every philosopher since the day of Plato. Among the Greeks, in ancient, as in the school of Pestalozzi and others in recent times, geometry was adopted as the best gymnastic of the mind. In fact, Euclid's Elements have become, by common consent, the basis of mathematical science all over the civilized globe. But this will not appear extraordinary, if we consider that this sublime science is not only better calculated than any other to call forth the spirit of inquiry, to elevate the mind, and to strengthen the reasoning faculties, but also it forms the best introduction to most of the useful and important vocations of human life. Arithmetic, land-surveying, hydrostatics, pneumatics, optics, physical astronomy, \&c.\ are all dependent on the propositions of geometry.}

\kerncharacters[0.005]{Much however depends on the first communication of any science to a learner, though the best and most easy methods are seldom adopted. Propositions are placed before a student, who though having a sufficient understanding, is told just as much about them on entering at the very threshold of the science, as given him a prepossession most unfavorable to his future study of this delightful subject; or \quotation{the formalities and paraphernalia of rigour are so ostentatiously put forward, as almost to hide the reality. Endless and perplexing repetitions, which do not confer greater exactitude on the reasoning, render the demonstrations involved and obscure, and conceal from the view of the student the consecution of evidence.} % quotation seems to be from The First Six Books of the Elements of Euclid by Dionysius Lardner https://books.google.ru/books?id=YnkAAAAAMAAJ
Thus an aversion is created in the mind of the pupil, and a subject so calculated to improve the reasoning powers, and give the habit of close thinking, is degraded by a dry and rigid course of instruction into an uninteresting exercise of the memory. To rise the curiosity, and to awaken the listless and dormant powers of younger minds should be the aim of every teacher; but where examples of excellence are wanting, the attempts to attain it are but few, while eminence excites attention and produces imitation. The object of this Work is to introduce a method of teaching geometry, which has been much approved of by many scientific men in this country, as well as in France and America. The plan here adopted forcibly appeals to the eye, the most sensitive and the most comprehensive of our external organs, and its pre-eminence to imprint its subject on the mind is supported by the incontrovertible maxim expressed in the well known words of Horace:—}

\kerncharacters[0.005]{All language consists of representative signs, and those signs are the best which effect their purposes with the greatest precision and dispatch. Such for all common purposes are the audible signs called words, which are still considered as audible, whether addressed immediately to the ear, or through the medium of letters to the eye. Geometrical diagrams are not signs, but the materials of geometrical science, the object of which is to show the relative quantities of their parts by a process of reasoning called Demonstration. This reasoning has been generally carried on by words, letters, and black or uncoloured diagrams; but as the use of coloured symbols, signs, and diagrams in the linear arts and sciences, renders the process of reasoning more precise, and the attainment more expeditious, they have been in this instance accordingly adopted.}

Such is the expedition of this enticing mode of communicating knowledge, that the Elements of Euclid can be acquired in less that one third of the time usually employed, and the retention by the memory is much more permanent; these facts have been ascertained by numerous experiments made by the inventor, and several others who have adopted his plans. The particulars of which are few and obvious; the letters annexed to points, lines, or other parts of a diagram are in fact but arbitrary names, and represent them in the demonstration; instead of these, the parts being differently coloured, are made to name themselves, for their forms in corresponding colours represent them in the demonstration.

In order to give a better idea of this system, and of advantages gained by its adoption, let us take a right angled triangle, and express some of its properties both by colours and the method generally employed.

In oral demonstrations we gain with colours this important advantage, the eye and the ear can be addressed at the same moment, so that for teaching geometry, and other linear arts and sciences, in classes, the system is best ever proposed, this is apparent from the examples given.

Whence it is evident that a reference from the text to the diagram is more rapid and sure, by giving the forms and colours of the parts, or by naming the parts and their colours, than naming the parts and letters on the diagram. Besides the superior simplicity, this system is likewise conspicuous for concentration, and wholly excludes the injurious though prevalent practice of allowing the student to commit the demonstration to memory; until reason, and fact, and proof only make impressions of the understanding.

Again, when lecturing on the principles or properties of figures, if we mention the colour of the part or parts referred to, as in saying, the red angle, the blue line, or lines, \&c, the part or parts thus named will be immediately seen by all the class at the same instant; not so if we say the angle ABC, the triangle PFQ, the figure EGKt, and so on; for the letters must be traced one by one before students arrange in their minds the particular magnitude referred to, which often occasions confusion and error, as well as loss of time. Also if the parts which are given as equal, have the same colours in any diagram, the mind will not wander from the object before it; that is, such an arrangement presents an ocular demonstration of the parts to be proved equal, and the learner retains the data throughout the whole of reasoning. But whatever may be the advantages of the present plan, if it be not substituted for, it can always be made a powerful auxiliary to the other methods, for the purpose of introduction, or of a more speedy reminiscence, or of more permanent retention by the memory.

The experience of all who have formed systems to impress facts on the understanding, agree in proving that coloured representations, as pictures, cuts, diagrams, \&c.\ are more easily fixed in the mind than mere sentences unmarked by any peculiarity. Curious as it may appear, poets seem to be aware of this fact more than mathematicians; many modern poets allude to this visible system of communicating knowledge, one of them has thus expressed himself:

This perhaps may be reckoned the only improvement which plain geometry has received since the days of Euclid, and if there were any geometers of note before that time, Euclid's success has quite eclipsed their memory, and even occasioned all good things of that kind to be assigned to him; like \AE sop among the writers of Fables. It may also be worthy of remark, as tangible diagrams afford the only medium through which geometry and other linear arts can be taught to the blind, the visible system is no less adapted to the exigencies of the deaf and dumb.

Care must be taken to show that colour has nothing to do with the lines, angles, or magnitudes, except merely to name them. A mathematical line, which is length without breadth, cannot possess colour, yet the junction of two colours on the same plane gives a good idea of what is meant by a mathematical line; recollect we are speaking familiarly, such a junction is to be understood and not the colour, when we say the black line, the red line or lines, \&c.

Colours and coloured diagrams may at first appear a clumsy method to convey proper notions of the properties and parts of mathematical figures and magnitudes, however they will be found to afford a means more refined and extensive than any that has hitherto proposed.

We shall here define a point a line, and a surface, and demonstrate a proposition in order to show the truth of this assertion.

A point is that which has position, but not magnitude; or a point is position only, abstracted from the consideration of length, breadth, and thickness. Perhaps the following description is better calculated to explain the nature of mathematical point to those who have not acquired the idea, than the above specious definition.

\defineNewPicture{
	angleScale := 2;
	pair O, A, B, C;
	O := (0, 0);
	A := dir(0) scaled 3u;
	B := dir(120) scaled 3u;
	C := dir(240) scaled 3u;
		draw byAngle(A, O, B, byred, 0);
		draw byAngle(B, O, C, byblue, 0);

Let three colours \drawCurrentPictureInMargin meet and cover a portion of the paper, where they meet is not blue, nor is it yellow, nor is it red, as it occupies no portion of the plane, for if it did, it would belong to the blue, the red, or the yellow part; yet it exists, and has position without magnitude, so that with a little reflection, this junction of three colours on a plane, gives a good idea of a mathematical point.

A line is length without breadth. With the assistance of colours, nearly in the same manner as before, an idea of a line may be thus given:—

\defineNewPicture{
	pair A, B, C, D, E, F;
	A := (0, 0);
	B := (5/2u, ypart(A));
	C := (xpart(A), -2u);
	D := (xpart(B), ypart(C));
	E := 1/2[A, C];
	F := 1/2[B, D];
		draw byPolygon(A,B,F,E)(byred);

}
\drawCurrentPictureInMargin
Let two colours meet and cover a portion of paper; where they meet is not red, nor is it blue; therefore the junction occupies no portion of the plane, and therefore it cannot have breadth, but only length: from which we can readily form an idea of what is meant by a mathematical line. For the purpose of illustration, one colour differing from the colour of the paper, or plane upon which it is drawn, would have been sufficient; hence in future, if we say the red line, the blue line or lines, \&c.\ it is the junctions with the plane upon which they are drawn are to be understood.

Surface if that which has length and breadth without thickness.

When we consider a solid body (PQ), we perceive at once that it has three dimensions, namely :— length, breadth, and thickness; suppose one part of this solid (PS) to be red, and the other part (QR) yellow, and that the colours be distinct without commingling, the blue surface (RS) which separates these parts, or which is the same thing, that which divides the solid without loss of material, must be without thickness, and only possesses length and breadth; this plainly appears from reasoning, similar to that just employed in defining, or rather describing a point and a line.

Let the equal sides AB and AC be produced through the extremities BC, of the third side, and in the produced part BD of either, let any point D be assumed, and from the other let AE be cut off equal to AD \inprop[prop:I.III]. Let points E and D, so taken in the produced sides, be connected by straight lines DC and BE with the alternate extremities of the third side of the triangle.

In the triangles DAC and EAB the sides DA and AC are respectively equal to EA and AB, and the included angle A is common to both triangles. Hence \inprop[prop:I.IV] the line DC is equal to BE, the angle ADC to the angle AEB, and the angle ACD to the angle ABE; if from the equal lines AD and AE the equal sides AB and AC be taken, the remainders BD and CE will be equal. Hence in the triangles BDC and CEB, the sides BD and DC are respectively equal to CE and EB, and the angles D and E included by those sides are also equal. Hence \inprop[prop:I.IV] the angles DBC and ECB, which are those included by the third side BC and the productions of the equal sides AB and AC are equal. Also the angles DCB and EBC are equal if those equals be taken from the angles DCA and EBA before proved equal, the remainders, which are the angles ABC and ACB opposite to the equal sides, will be equal.

Our object in this place being to introduce system rather than to teach any particular set of propositions, we have therefore selected the foregoing out of the regular course. For schools and other public places of instruction, dyed chalks will answer to describe the diagrams, \&c.\ for private use coloured pencils will be found very convenient.

We are happy to find that the Elements of Mathematics now forms a considerable part of every sound female education, therefore we call the attention to those interested or engaged in the education of ladies to this very attractive mode of communicating knowledge, and to the succeeding work for its future developement.

We shall for the present conclude by observing, as the senses of sight and hearing can be so forcibly and instantaneously addressed alike with one thousand as with one, \emph{the million} might be taught geometry and other branches of mathematics with great ease, this would advance the purpose of education more than any thing \emph{might} be named, for it would teach the people how to think, and not what to think; it is in this particular the great error of education originates.

Angles might properly be considered as a fourth species of magnitude. Angular magnitude evidently consists of parts, and must therefore be admitted to be a species of quantity. The student must not suppose that the magnitude of an angle is affected by the length of the straight lines which include it and of whose mutual divergence it is the measure. The \emph{vertex} of an angle is the point the \emph{sides} of the \emph{legs} of the angle meet, as A.

An angle is often designated by a single letter when its legs are the only lines which meet together at its vertex. Thus the red and blue lines form the yellow angle, which in other systems would be called angle A. But when more than two lines meet in the same point, it was necessary by former methods, in order to avoid confusion, to employ three letters to designate an angle about that point, the letter which marked the vertex of the angle being always placed in the middle. Thus the black and red lines meeting together at C, form the blue angle, and has been usually denominated the angle FCD or DCF. The lines FC and CD are the legs of the angle; the point C is its vertex. In like manner the black angle would be designated the angle DCB or BCD. The red and blue angles added together, or the angle HCF added to FCD, make the angle HCD; and so of other angles.

When the legs of an angle are produced or prolonged beyond its vertex, the angles made by them on both sides of the vertex are said to be \emph{vertically opposite} to each other: thus the red and yellow angles are said to be vertically opposite angles.

\emph{Superposition} is the process by which one magnitude may be conceived to be placed upon another, so as exactly to cover it, or so that every part of each shall exactly coincide.

A line is said to be \emph{produced}, when it is extended, prolonged, or it has length increased, and the increase of length which it receives is called \emph{produced part}, or its \emph{production}.

The entire length of the line or lines which enclose a figure, is called its \emph{perimeter}. The first six books of Euclid treat of plain figures only. A line drawn from the centre of a circle to its circumference, is called a \emph{radius}. That side of a right angled triangle, which is opposite to the right angle, is called the \emph{hypotenuse}. An oblong is defined in the second book, and called a \emph{rectangle}. All lines which are considered in the first six books of the Elements are supposed to be in the same plane.

The \emph{straight-edge} and \emph{compasses} are the only instruments, the use of which is permitted in Euclid, or plain Geometry. To declare this restriction is the object of the \emph{postulates.}

The \emph{Axioms} of geometry are certain general propositions, the truth of which is taken to be self-evident and incapable of being established by demonstration.

\emph{Propositions} are those results which are obtained in geometry by a process of reasoning. There are two species of propositions in geometry, \emph{problems} and \emph{theorems}.

A \emph{Problem} is a proposition in which something is proposed to be done; as a line to be drawn under some given conditions, a circle to be described, some figure to be constructed, \&c.

The \emph{solution} of the problem consists in showing how the thing required may be done by the aid of the rule or straight-edge and compasses.

The \emph{demonstration} consists in proving that the process indicated in the solution attains the required end.

A \emph{Theorem} is a proposition in which the truth of some principle is asserted. This principle must be deduced from the axioms and definitions, or other truths previously and independently established. To show this is the object of demonstration.

A \emph{Problem} is analogous to a postulate.

A \emph{Theorem} resembles an axiom.

A \emph{Postulate} is a problem, the solution to which is assumed.

An \emph{Axiom} is a theorem, the truth of which is granted without demonstration.

A \emph{Corollary} is an inference deduced immediately from a proposition.

A \emph{Scholium} is a note or observation on a proposition not containing an inference of sufficient importance to entitle it to the name of \emph{corollary}.

A \emph{Lemma} is a proposition merely introduced for the purpose of establishing some more important proposition.

 expresses an \emph{analogy} or \emph{proportion}; thus if A, B, C and D represent four magnitudes, and A has to B the same ratio that C has to D, the proportion is thus briefly written

$A : B :: C : D$, $A : B = C : D$, or $\dfrac{A}{B} = \dfrac{C}{D}$.

This equality or sameness of ratio is read,

as A is to B, so is C to D;

or A is to B, as C is to D.

\symb{$\parallel$}
 signifies \emph{parallel to}.

\symb{$\perp$}
 signifies \emph{perpendicular to}.

briefly designates a \emph{point}.

The square described on a line is concisely written thus, $\drawUnitLine{AD}^2$.

In the same manner twice the square of, is expressed by $2 \cdot \drawUnitLine{AD}^2$.

\symb{\indefstr}
 signifies \emph{definition}.

\symb{\inpoststr}
 signifies \emph{postulate}.

\symb{\inaxstr}
 signifies \emph{axiom}.

\symb{hyp.}
 signifies \emph{hypothesis}. It may be necessary here to remark, that \emph{hypothesis} is the condition assumed or taken for granted. Thus, the hypothesis of the proposition given in the Introduction, is that the triangle is isosceles, or that its legs are equal.

\symb{\conststr}
 signifies \emph{construction}. The \emph{construction} is the change made in the original figure, by drawing lines, making angles, describing circles, \&c.\ in order to adapt it to the argument of the demonstration or the solution of the problem. The conditions under which these changes are made, are as indisputable as those contained in the hypothesis. For instance, if we make an angle equal to a given angle, these two angles are equal by construction.

\symb{\qedstr}
signifies \emph{Quod erat demonstrandum}. Which was to be demonstrated.

Draw \drawUnitLine{FD}, \drawUnitLine{FC}, \drawUnitLine{FB}, \drawUnitLine{FE}, \&c.

$\because \drawUnitLine{KD,CK} = \drawUnitLine{HC,BH}$, $\drawAngle{HCF} = \drawAngle{FCK}$, and \drawUnitLine{FC} common to the two triangles %Because

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{FB} = \drawUnitLine{FD}$ and $\drawAngle{FBH} = \drawAngle{KDF}$ \inprop[prop:I.IV]

And $\because \drawAngle{B} = \drawAngle{D} = \mbox{ twice } \drawAngle{KDF}$ %because

$\therefore \mbox{ twice } \drawAngle{FBH}$, hence \drawAngle{B} is bisected by \drawUnitLine{FB}.

In like manner it may be demonstrated that \drawAngle{DEF,FEM} is bisected by \drawUnitLine{FE}, and that the remaining angle of the polygon is bisected in a similar manner.

Draw \drawUnitLine{FK}, \drawUnitLine{FH}, \&c.\ perpendicular to the sides of the pentagon.

Then in the two triangles

we have $\drawAngle{HCF} = \drawAngle{FCK}$ (\conststr), \drawUnitLine{FC} common,\\

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{FK} = \drawUnitLine{FH}$ \inprop[prop:I.XXVI]

In the same way it may be shown that the five perpendiculars on the sides of the pentagon are equal to one another.

Describe \drawCircle[middle][1/5]{F} with any one of the perpendiculars as radius, and it will be the inscribed circle required. For if it does not touch the sides of the pentagon, but cut them, then a line drawn from the extremity at right angles to the diameter of a circle will fall within the circle, which has been shown to be absurd \inprop[prop:III.XVI].

And so on, with any other equimultiples of the four magnitudes, taken in the same manner.

\vskip \baselineskip

Euclid expresses this definition as follows :—

The first of four magnitudes is said to have the same ratio to the second, which the third has to the fourth, when equimultiples whatsoever of the first and third being taken, and any equimultiples whatsoever of the second and fourth; if the multiple of the first be less than that of the second, and the multiple of the third is also less than that of the fourth; or, if the multiple of the first be equal to that of the second, the multiple of the third is also equal to that of the fourth; or, if the multiple of the first be greater than that of the second, the multiple of the third is also greater than that of the fourth.

In future we shall express this definition generally, thus:

\startCenterAlign
$\eqalign{
\mbox{If }M \drawMagnitude{A} &>, = \mbox{ or } < m \drawMagnitude{B} \mbox{,}\cr
\mbox{when }M \drawMagnitude{C} &>, = \mbox{ or } < m \drawMagnitude{D} \mbox{,}\cr
}$
\stopCenterAlign

Then we infer that \drawMagnitude{A}, the first, has the same ratio to \drawMagnitude{B}, the second, which \drawMagnitude{C}, the third, has to \drawMagnitude{D} the fourth; expressed in the succeeding demonstrations thus:

\startCenterAlign
$\eqalign{
\drawMagnitude{A} : \drawMagnitude{B} & :: \drawMagnitude{C} : \drawMagnitude{D} \mbox{;} \cr
\mbox{or thus, } \drawMagnitude{A} : \drawMagnitude{B} &= \drawMagnitude{C} : \drawMagnitude{D} \mbox{;} \cr
\mbox{or thus, } \dfrac{\drawMagnitude{A}}{\drawMagnitude{B}} &= \dfrac{\drawMagnitude{C}}{\drawMagnitude{D}} \mbox{:} \cr
}$

and is read, \\
\quotation{as \drawMagnitude{A} is to \drawMagnitude{B}, so is \drawMagnitude{C} to \drawMagnitude{D}.}

And if $\drawMagnitude{A} : \drawMagnitude{B} :: \drawMagnitude{C} : \drawMagnitude{D}$ we shall infer if \\
$M \drawMagnitude{A} >, = \mbox{ or } < m \drawMagnitude{B}$, then will \\
$M \drawMagnitude{C} >, = \mbox{ or } < m \drawMagnitude{D}$.
\stopCenterAlign

That is, if the first be to the second, as the third is to the fourth; then if $M$ times the first be greater than, equal to, or less than $m$ times the second, then shall $M$ times third be greater than, equal to, or less than $m$ times the fourth, in which $M$ and $m$ are not to be considered particular multiples, but every pair of multiples whatever; nor are such marks as \drawMagnitude{A}, \drawMagnitude{D}, \drawMagnitude{B}, \&c.\ to be considered any more than representatives of geometrical magnitudes.

The student should throughly understand this definition before proceeding further.

When of the equimultiples of four magnitudes (taken as in the fifth definition), the multiple of the first is greater than that of the second, but multiple of the third is not greater than the multiple of the fourth; then the first is said to have to the second a greater ratio than the third magnitude has to the fourth: and, on the contrary, the third is said to have to the fourth a less ratio than the first has to the second.

If, among the equimultiples of four magnitudes, compared in the fifth definition, we should find $\drawMagnitude{I} > \drawMagnitude{II}$, but $\drawMagnitude{III} = \mbox{ or } > \drawMagnitude{IV}$, or if we should find any particular multiple $M'$ of the first and third, and a particular multiple $m'$ of the second and fourth, such, that $M'$ times the first is $> m'$ times the second, but $M'$ times the third is not $> m'$ times the fourth, i.\ e.\ $= \mbox{ or } < m'$ times the fourth; then the first is said to have to the second a greater ratio than the third has to the fourth; or the third has to the fourth, under such circumstances, a less ratio than the first has to the second: although several other equimultiples may tend to show that the four magnitudes are proportionals.

This definition will in future be expressed thus :—

\startCenterAlign
If $M' \drawMagnitude{Ia} > m' \drawMagnitude{IIa}$, but $M' \drawMagnitude{IIIa} = \mbox{ or } < m' \drawMagnitude{IVa}$,\\
then $\magnitudeIa : \magnitudeIIa > \magnitudeIIIa : \magnitudeIVa$.
\stopCenterAlign

In the above general expression, $M'$ and $m'$ are to be considered particular multiples, not like the multiples $M$ and $m$ introduced in the fifth definition, which are in that definition considered to be every pair of multiples that can be taken. It must also be here observed, that \magnitudeIa, \magnitudeIIa, \magnitudeIIIa, and the like symbols are to be considered merely the representatives of geometrical magnitudes.

In a partial arithmetical way, this may be set forth as follows:

Let us take the four numbers $\color[byred]{8}$, $\color[byblack]{7}$, $\color[byblue]{10}$, and $\color[byyellow]{9}$.

Among the above multiples we find $\color[byred]{16} > \color[byblack]{14}$ and $\color[byblue]{20} > \color[byyellow]{18}$; that is, twice the first is greater than twice the second, and twice the third is greater than twice the fourth; and $\color[byred]{16} < \color[byblack]{21}$ and $\color[byblue]{20} < \color[byyellow]{27}$; that is, twice the first is less than three times the second, and twice the third is less than three times the fourth; and among the same multiples we can find $\color[byred]{72} > \color[byblack]{56}$ and $\color[byblue]{90} > \color[byyellow]{72}$; that is, 9 times the first is greater than 8 times the second, and 9 times the third is greater than 8 times the fourth. Many other equimultiples might be selected, which would tend to show that the numbers $\color[byred]{8}$, $\color[byblack]{7}$, $\color[byblue]{10}$, and $\color[byyellow]{9}$ were proportionals, but they are not, for we can find multiple of the first $>$ a multiple of the second, but the same multiple of the third that has been taken of the first not $>$ the same multiple of the fourth which has been taken to the second; for instance, 9 times the first is $>$ 10 times the second, but 9 times the third is not $>$ 10 times the fourth, that is $\color[byred]{72} > \color[byblack]{70}$, but $\color[byblue]{90} \ngtr \color[byyellow]{90}$, or 8 times the first we find $>$ 9 times the second, but 8 times the third is not greater than 9 times the fourth, that is, $\color[byred]{64} > \color[byblack]{63}$, but $\color[byblue]{80} \mbox{ not } > \color[byyellow]{81}$. When any such multiples as these can be found, the first $\color[byred]{(8)}$ is said to have the second $\color[byblack]{(7)}$ a greater ratio than the third $\color[byblue]{(10)}$ has to the fourth $\color[byyellow]{(9)}$, and on the contrary the third $\color[byblue]{(10)}$ is said to have to the fourth $\color[byyellow]{(9)}$ a less ratio than the first $\color[byred]{(8)}$ has to the second $\color[byblack]{(7)}$.

We shall first prove that \magnitudeI\ which is the greater of the two unequal magnitudes, has a greater ratio to \magnitudeIII\ than \magnitudeII, the less, has to \magnitudeIII; that is, $\magnitudeI : \magnitudeIII > \magnitudeII : \magnitudeIII$;

$\therefore M' \magnitudeII \mbox{ is } \ngtr m' \magnitudeIII$,\\ %\mbox{is not} >

as $m' \magnitudeIII$ is the first multiple which first becomes $> M' \magnitudeIb$, than $(m' - 1)\magnitudeIII$ or $m' \magnitudeIII - \magnitudeIII$ is $\ngtr M' \magnitudeIa$, and $\magnitudeIII \ngtr M' \magnitudeIa$ %two times\mbox{ minus } and \mbox{is not} >

$\therefore m' \magnitudeIII - \magnitudeIII + \magnitudeIII$ must be $< M' \magnitudeIb + M' \magnitudeIa$;\\ %\mbox{ minus }
that is, $m' \magnitudeIII$ must be $< M' \magnitudeI$;

$\therefore M' \magnitudeI \mbox{ is } > m' \magnitudeIII$; but it has been shown above that $M' \magnitudeII \mbox{ is } \ngtr m' \magnitudeIII$, therefore, by the seventh definition, \magnitudeI\ has to \magnitudeIII\ a greater ratio than $\magnitudeII : \magnitudeIII$. % \mbox{ is not } >

Next we shall prove that \magnitudeIII\ has a greater ratio to \magnitudeII, the less, than it has to \magnitudeI, the greater;\\
or, $\magnitudeIII : \magnitudeII > \magnitudeIII : \magnitudeI$.

Take $m' \magnitudeIII$, $M' \magnitudeII$, $m' \magnitudeIII$ and $M' \magnitudeI$,\\
the same as in the first case, such that\\
$M' \magnitudeIa$ and $M' \magnitudeIb$ will be each $> \magnitudeIII$, and $m' \magnitudeIII$ the least multiple of \magnitudeIII, which first becomes greater than $M' \magnitudeIb = M' \magnitudeII$.

The contrivance employed in this proposition for finding among the multiples taken, as in the fifth definition, a multiple of the first greater than the multiple of the second, but the same multiple of the third which has been taken of the first, not greater than the same multiple of the fourth which has been taken of the second, may be illustrated numerically as follows :—

The number $\color[byblack]{9}$ has a greater ratio to $\color[byblue]{7}$ than $\color[byyellow]{8}$ has to $\color[byblue]{7}$: that is, $\color[byblack]{9} : \color[byblue]{7} > \color[byyellow]{8} : \color[byblue]{7}$; or $\color[byred]{8} + \color[byblack]{1} : \color[byblue]{7} > \color[byyellow]{8} : \color[byblue]{7}$.

The multiple of $\color[byblack]{1}$, which first becomes greater than $\color[byblue]{7}$, is $8$ times, therefore, we may multiply the first and third by $8$, $9$, $10$, or any other greater number; in this case, let us multiply the first and third by $8$, and we have $\color[byred]{64} + \color[byblack]{8}$ and $\color[byyellow]{64}$: again, the first multiple of $\color[byblue]{7}$ which becomes greater than $64$ is $10$ times; then, by multiplying the second and fourth by $10$, we shall have $\color[byblue]{70}$ and $\color[byblue]{70}$; then, arranging these multiples, we have—

}}\hfill\
\protect
\stopCenterAlign

Consequently $\color[byred]{64} + \color[byblack]{8}$, or $72$, is greater than $\color[byblue]{70}$, but $\color[byyellow]{64}$ is not greater than $\color[byblue]{70}$, $\therefore$ by the seventh definition $\color[byblack]{9}$ has a greater ratio to $\color[byblue]{7}$ than $\color[byyellow]{8}$ has to $\color[byblue]{7}$.

The above is merely illustrative of the foregoing demonstration, for this property could be shown of these or other numbers very readily in the following manner; because, if an antecedent contains its consequent a greater number of times than another antecedent contains its consequent, or when a fraction is formed of an antecedent for the numerator, and its consequent for the denominator be greater than another fraction which is formed of another antecedent for the numerator and its consequent for the denominator, the ratio of the first antecedent to its consequent is greater than the ratio of the last antecedent to its consequent.

Thus, the number $9$ has a greater ratio to $7$, than $8$ has to $7$, for $\frac{9}{7}$ is greater than $\frac{8}{7}$.

Again, $17 : 19$ is a greater ratio than $13 : 15$, because $\frac{17}{19} = \frac{17 \times 15}{19 \times 15} = \frac{255}{185}$, and $\frac{13}{15} = \frac{13 \times 19}{15 \times 19} = \frac{247}{185}$, hence it is evident that $\frac{255}{185}$ is greater than $\frac{247}{185}$, $\therefore \frac{17}{19}$ is greater than $\frac{13}{15}$, and, according to what has been above shown, $17$ has to $19$ a greater ratio than $13$ has to $15$.

So that the general terms upon which a greater, equal, or less ratio exists are as follows :—

If $\frac{A}{B}$ be greater than $\frac{C}{D}$, $A$ is said to have to $B$ a greater ratio than $C$ has to $D$; if $\frac{A}{B}$ be equal to $\frac{C}{D}$, then $A$ has to $B$ the same ratio which $C$ has to $D$; and if $\frac{A}{B}$ be less to $\frac{C}{D}$, $A$ is said to have to $B$ a less ratio than $C$ has to $D$.

The student should understand all up to this proposition perfectly before proceeding further, in order fully to comprehend the following propositions of this book. We therefore strongly recommend the learner to commence again, and read up to this slowly, and carefully reason at each step, as he proceeds, particularly guarding against the mischievous system of depending wholly on the memory. By following these instructions, he will find that the parts which usually present considerable difficulties will present no difficulties whatever, in prosecuting the study of this important book.

This may be shown otherwise, as follows :—

Let $\color[byyellow]{A} : \color[byblue]{B} = \color[byyellow]{A} : \color[byred]{C}$, then $\color[byblue]{B} = \color[byred]{C}$, for, as the fraction $\frac{\color[byyellow]{A}}{\color[byblue]{B}} = \mbox{ the fraction } \frac{\color[byyellow]{A}}{\color[byred]{C}}$, and the numerator of one equal to the numerator of the other, therefore, denominators of these fractions are equal, that is $\color[byblue]{B} = \color[byred]{C}$.

Again, if $\color[byblue]{B} : \color[byyellow]{A} = \color[byred]{C} : \color[byyellow]{A}$, $\color[byblue]{B} = \color[byred]{C}$. For, as $\frac{\color[byblue]{B}}{\color[byyellow]{A}} = \frac{\color[byred]{C}}{\color[byyellow]{A}}$, $\color[byblue]{B} \mbox{ must } = \color[byred]{C}$.

The technical term permutando, or alternando, by permutation or alternately, is used when there are four proportionals, and it is inferred that the first has the same ratio to the third which the second has to the fourth; or that the first is to the third as the second to the fourth: as is shown in the following proposition :—

\startCenterAlign
Let $\drawMagnitude{I} : \drawMagnitude{II} :: \drawMagnitude{III} : \drawMagnitude{IV}$,\\
by \quotation{permutando} or \quotation{alternando} it is inferred\\
$\magnitudeI : \magnitudeIII :: \magnitudeII : \magnitudeIV$.

It may be necessary here to remark that the magnitudes \magnitudeI, \magnitudeII, \magnitudeIII, \magnitudeIV, must be homogeneous, that is, of the same nature or similitude of kind; we must therefore, in such cases, compare lines with lines, surfaces with surfaces, solids with solids, \&c. Hence the student will readily perceive that a line and a surface, a surface and a solid, or other heterogenous magnitudes, can never stand in the relation of antecedent and consequent.

For example, if $\varA, \varB, \varC, \varD$, be four magnitudes of the same kind, the first $\varA$ is said to have to the last $\varD$ the ratio compounded of the ratio of $\varA$ to $\varB$, and of the ratio of $\varB$ to $\varC$, and of the ratio of $\varC$ to $\varD$; or, the ratio of $\varA$ to $\varD$ is said to be compounded of the ratios of $\varA$ to $\varB$, $\varB$ to $\varC$, and $\varC$ to $\varD$.

And if $\varA$ has to $\varB$ the same ratio which $\varE$ has to $\varF$, and $\varB$ to $\varC$ the same ratio that $\varG$ has to $\varH$, and $\varC$ to $\varD$ the same that $\varK$ has to $\varL$; then by this definition, $\varA$ is said to have to $\varD$ the ratio compounded of ratios which are the same with the ratios of $\varE$ to $\varF$, $\varG$ to $\varH$, and $\varK$ to $\varL$. And the same thing is to be saying, $\varA$ has to $\varD$ the ratio compounded of the ratios of $\varE$ to $\varF$, $\varG$ to $\varH$, and $\varK$ to $\varL$.

In like manner, the same things being supposed; if $\varM$ has to $\varN$ the same ratio which $\varA$ has to $\varD$, then for shortness sake, $\varM$ is said to have to $\varN$ the ratio compounded of the ratios $\varE$ to $\varF$, $\varG$ to $\varH$, and $\varK$ to $\varL$.

This definition may be better understood from an arithmetical or algebraical illustration; for, in fact, a ratio compounded of several other ratios, is nothing more than a ratio which has for its antecedent the continued product of all antecedents of the ratios compounded, and for its consequent the continued product of all the consequents of the ratios compounded.

Then, by the definition of a compound ratio, the ratio of $\vara : \varg$ is compounded of the ratios of $\vara : \varb$, $\varb : \varc$, $\varc : \vard$, $\vard : \vare$, $\vare : \varf$, $\varf : \varg$, which are the same as the ratio of $\varA : \varB$, $\varC : \varD$, $\varE : \varF$, $\varG : \varH$, $\varK : \varL$, $\varM : \varN$, each to each.

And let the ratios of $h : s$, which is compounded of the ratios of $h : k$, $k : m$, $m : n$, $n : s$, which are the same as the remaining first ratios, namely, $\varE : \varF$, $\varG : \varH$, $\varK : \varL$, $\varM : \varN$; also, let the ratio of $e : g$, be that which is compounded of the ratios $e : f$ , $f : g$, which are the same, each to each, to the remaining other ratios, namely $\varV : \varW$, $\varX : \varY$.

Let the triangles \drawPolygon[bottom]{ABC} and \drawPolygon[bottom]{ACD} have a common vertex, and their bases \drawUnitLine{BC} and \drawUnitLine{CD} in the same straight line.

Produce \drawUnitLine{BC,CD} both ways, take successively on \drawUnitLine{CD} produced lines equal to it; and on \drawUnitLine{BC} produced lines successively equal to it; and draw lines from the common vertex to their extremities.

Let the equiangular triangles be so placed that two sides \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{EC} opposite to equal angles \drawAngle{D} and \drawAngle{A} may be conterminous, and in the same straight line; and that the triangles lying at the same side of that straight line; and that the triangles lying at the same side of that straight line, may have the equal angles not conterminous, i.\ e.\ \drawAngle{DCE} opposite to \drawAngle{B}, and \drawAngle{BCA} to \drawAngle{E}.

Resolve the given figure into triangles by drawing the lines \drawUnitLine{DF} and \drawUnitLine{DE}.

At the extremities of \drawUnitLine{AB} make\\
$\drawAngle{GBA} = \drawAngle{FDC}$ and $\drawAngle{A} = \drawAngle{C}$;\\

Then $\polygonCD = \drawPolygon[middle][polygonAB]{BAG,BGH,BHK}$.

It is evident from the construction and \inprop[prop:I.XXXII] that the figures are equiangular; and since the triangles \drawPolygon{DCF} and \drawPolygon{BAG} are equiangular;\\
then by \inprop[prop:VI.IV],
$\drawUnitLine{AB}:\drawUnitLine{AG} :: \drawUnitLine{CD} : \drawUnitLine{CF}$\\

In like manner it may be shown that the remaining sides of the two figures are proportional.

Draw \drawUnitLine{BE} and \drawUnitLine{BD}, and \drawUnitLine{GL} and \drawUnitLine{GK}, resolving the polygons into triangles. Then because the polygons are similar, $\drawAngle{C} = \drawAngle{H}$, and $\drawUnitLine{BC} : \drawUnitLine{CD} :: \drawUnitLine{GH} : \drawUnitLine{HK}$

$\therefore$ \drawPolygon{BCD} and \drawPolygon{GHK} are similar,\\
and $\drawAngle{BDC} = \drawAngle{GKH}$ \inprop[prop:VI.VI];

but $\drawAngle{BDE,BDC} = \drawAngle{GKL,GKH}$ because they are angles of similar polygons; therefore the remainders \drawAngle{BDE} and \drawAngle{GKL} are equal;\\
hence $\drawUnitLine{BD} : \drawUnitLine{CD} :: \drawUnitLine{GK} : \drawUnitLine{HK}$,\\
on account of the similar triangles,\\
and $\drawUnitLine{CD} : \drawUnitLine{DE} :: \drawUnitLine{HK} : \drawUnitLine{KL}$,\\

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{BD} : \drawUnitLine{DE} :: \drawUnitLine{GK} : \drawUnitLine{KL}$,\\
ex \ae quali \inprop[prop:V.XXII], and as these proportional sides contain equal angles, the triangles \drawPolygon{BDE} and \drawPolygon{GKL} are similar \inprop[prop:VI.VI].

In like manner it may be shown that the triangles \drawPolygon{BEA} and \drawPolygon{GLF} are similar.

But \drawPolygon{BCD} is to \drawPolygon{GHK} in the duplicate ratio of \drawUnitLine{BD} to \drawUnitLine{GK} \inprop[prop:VI.XIX],\\

Again \drawPolygon{BDE} is to \drawPolygon{GKL} in the duplicate ratio of \drawUnitLine{BE} to \drawUnitLine{GL}, and \drawPolygon{BEA} is to \drawPolygon{GLF} in the duplicate ratio of \drawUnitLine{BE} to \drawUnitLine{GL}.\\

and as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so is the sum of all the antecedents to the sum of all the consequents; that is to say, the similar triangles have to one another the same ratio as the polygons \inprop[prop:V.XII].


But \drawPolygon{BCD} is to \drawPolygon{GHK} in the duplicate ratio of \drawUnitLine{BC} to \drawUnitLine{GH};\\

For it has been demonstrated already \inprop[prop:II.V], that the square of half the line is equal to the rectangle contained by any unequal segments together with the square of the part intermediate between the middle point and the point of unequal section. The square described on half the line exceeds therefore the rectangle contained by any unequal segments of the line.

The since the arcs \arcBC, \arcCK, \arcKL, \&c.\ are all equal, the angles \drawAngle{BC}, \drawAngle{CK}, \drawAngle{KL}, \&c.\ are also equal \inprop[prop:III.XXVII]; $\therefore$ \drawAngle{BC,CK,KL} is the same multiple of \drawAngle{BC} which the arc \drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][arcBL]{
startGlobalRotation(180-angle(B-L));
draw byNamedArc(BC,CK,KL);
stopGlobalRotation;
} is of \arcBC; and in the same manner \drawAngle{EF,FM,MN} is the same multiple of \drawAngle{EF}, which the arc \drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][arcEN]{
startGlobalRotation(180-angle(E-N));
draw byNamedArc(EF,FM,MN);
stopGlobalRotation;
} is of the arc \arcEF.

Then it is evident \inprop[prop:III.XXVII],\\
if \drawAngle{BC,CK,KL} (or if $m$ times \drawAngle{BC}) $>, =, < \drawAngle{EF,FM,MN}$ (or $n$ times \drawAngle{EF})\\
then \arcBL (or $m$ times \arcBC) $>, =, < \arcEN$ (or $n$ times \arcEF);
\stopCenterAlign

$\therefore \drawAngle{BC} : \drawAngle{EF} :: \arcBC\ : \arcEF$ \indef[def:V.V], or the angles at the centre are as the arcs on which they stand; but the angles at the circumference being halves of the angles at the centre \inprop[prop:III.XX] are in the same ratio \inprop[prop:V.XV], and therefore are as the arcs on which they stand.

It is evident, that sectors in equal circles, and on equal arcs are equal (\inpropL[prop:I.IV], \inpropN[prop:III.XXIV], \inpropN[prop:III.XXVII], and \indefL[def:III.IX]). Hence, if the sectors be substituted for the angles in the above demonstration, the second part of the proportion will be established, that is, in equal circles the sectors have the same ratio to one another as the arcs on which they stand.
